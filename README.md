Caliburn+MahApps+Autofac Example

This is a prototype UI application to document code patterns for a small multi-screen app sucn as would be used for 
a departmental business solution.  It demonstrates the following:
-Using all the various types of MahApps dialogs capturing return values from them.
-Launching modal and non-modal child windows where the windows are instances of MahApps MetroWindow, but the windows are
conducted via the Caliburn Conductor<Screen> mechanism.
-An editable datagrid that demonstrates the nice MahApps numeric updown control and overall modern appearance.
-The (very) basic charting that comes in the WPF Toolkit (in other words, free) with WPF.
-Data entry validation using INotifyDataErrorInfo, including attribute-based validation and allowance for more complex validation
involving multiple properties at once.
-Async processing with progress tracking and cancellation token.
-MahApps Flyout
